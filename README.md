# ecg-arrhythmia-detection
Deep learning model for automated classification of cardiac arrhythmias using ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database. The project combines signal preprocessing via wavelet transform and a multi-layer CNN architecture, achieving over 98% test accuracy across 15 heartbeat classes. Designed for real-time and clinical applications.
